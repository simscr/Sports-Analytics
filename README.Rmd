# Sports-Analytics
This is a repo for sports analytics.

I would like to get more familiar with MLB and Global Soccer/Football Data.

## Goals

1. ~~Plot average for St. Louis Cardinals in the 2021 season with a before and after based on when they started playing better.~~
2. ~~Plot soccer passing as a polar geom_density plot.~~
3. ~~PCA based on AB results and Pitch Type.~~
4. ~~Soccer passing radar with ggperiodic.~~
5. ~~Shot locations.~~
6. Revisit #3, but with [{tidymodels}](https://www.tidymodels.org/)
7. USMNT Players on [transfermrkt](https://www.transfermarkt.us/)
