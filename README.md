# Sports-Analytics
This is a repo for sports analytics.

I would like to get more familiar with MLB and Global Soccer/Football Data.

## Goals

1. Plot average for St. Louis Cardinals in the 2021 season with a before and after based on when they started playing better.
2. Plot soccer passing as a polar geom_density plot.
3. PCA based on AB results and Pitch Type.
