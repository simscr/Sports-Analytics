This is a repo for sports analytics.

I would like to get more familiar with MLB and Global Soccer/Football
Data.

## Goals

1.  ~~Plot average for St. Louis Cardinals in the 2021 season with a
    before and after based on when they started playing better.~~
2.  ~~Plot soccer passing as a polar geom_density plot.~~
3.  ~~PCA based on AB results and Pitch Type.~~
4.  ~~Soccer passing radar with ggperiodic.~~
5.  Shot locations in goal.
6.  Revisit #3, but with {tidymodels}
7.  USMNT Players on transfermrkt
